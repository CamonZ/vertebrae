# /list

List and filter tasks. Displays tasks in a tree view by default.

## Basic listing

```bash
vtb list                          # All tasks (tree view)
vtb list --flat                   # Flat table view
vtb list --status todo            # By status
vtb list --status in_progress     # Currently active
vtb list --level epic             # By level
vtb list --priority high          # By priority
vtb list --tag backend            # By tag
```

## Filtering by workflow

```bash
vtb list --workflow implementation  # Tasks in specific workflow
vtb list --step review              # Tasks at specific step
vtb list -w impl --step coding      # Combine workflow and step
```

## Filtering by parent

```bash
vtb list --parent <ID>            # Show children of a specific task
vtb list --parent abc123 --all    # Include done children
vtb list --root                   # Show only root items (no parent)
```

## Additional options

```bash
vtb list --all                    # Include done items (excluded by default)
vtb list --search "auth"          # Search in title and description
```
